CSolve
======

Prerequisites
-------------

CSolve requires a recent OCaml compiler and the CamlIDL library.

dsolve can only be compiled on Linux at the moment.

Checking Out Of Git
-------------------

To clone CSolve from git:

git clone meatwad.ucsd.edu:/git/csolve

Change into the csolve directory and execute:

1. git submodule init
2. git submodule update

Configuring and Compiling
-------------------------

NOTE:
If you downloaded CSolve off the web, you need to download Z3 first.
Please see the section below for instructions.

To begin building CSolve, run the following commands in the root
directory of the source distribution:

1. ./configure
2. ./build.sh

To build CSolve after this step, run make in the src/ directory.

Downloading Z3
--------------

For legal reasons, we cannot distribute the Z3 SMT solver that CSolve
requires.  Instead, you must download Z3 2.4 for Linux from

  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html

Untar the file in the external/ subdirectory; this will create the
directory external/z3.  You can now proceed to build CSolve.

Testing CSolve
--------------

To ensure that everything compiled successfully and CSolve is properly
configured, change into the src/ directory and run

./regrtest.py

All tests should pass.
