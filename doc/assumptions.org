Assumptions CSolve uses in typechecking

* malloc () zero-initializes memory
  The allocated memory returned from malloc () is assumed to be
  initialized with all zeroes.

* Stack-allocated structures are zero-initialized
  Similarly, structures allocated on the stack are assumed to have
  their contents zeroed out.

* Absence of arithmetic overflow
  Integer-valued variables are treated as mathematical integers by
  CSolve; overflow is not accounted for.
