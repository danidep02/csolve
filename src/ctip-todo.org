* Interprocedural Ctypes: The Big TODO

** Yet To Do
*** Consgen
*** Let local inference and whole-program spec inference coexist
*** Revert Ranjit's code to its stringy gory
*** Clear up disaster in consgen wrt stringmaps vs. varmaps
    No reason for stringmaps, potentially unsafe.

*** Clear up disaster in inferctypes constraint generation
    Lists of lists of constraints, etc, all in a very ad-hoc way.
    How to tame?
*** Add deferred pointer arithmetic checks
    As on 9/29...

    *Will have to emit a warning!* Since we're not actually doing the
    check, just emitting a check assuming the check gets done...

** Done
*** Immutable slocs

*** Generate a callgraph
    Need to visit functions in topological order, need one heap var per SCC.

*** Structures

**** Heap variables

**** Substitutions

**** Function types over heaps, location sets

**** Constraints
     Need variants with constants on one side where it makes sense.

***** Subheaping
***** Heap dom inclusion
***** Inclusion in location
***** Subtyping
***** WF substs

**** Solutions

***** Index solutions
***** Index unifiers
***** Location substitutions
***** Heap domains
***** Location solutions
*** Merge annotation and constraint generation
    On paper, these are separate; in the implementation they need to be merged.
