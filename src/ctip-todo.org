* Interprocedural Ctypes: The Big TODO

** Yet To Do

*** Immutable slocs

*** Generate a callgraph
    Need to visit functions in topological order, need one heap var per SCC.

*** Merge annotation and constraint generation
    On paper, these are separate; in the implementation they need to be merged.

*** Structures

**** Heap variables

**** Substitutions

**** Function types over heaps, location sets

**** Constraints
     Need variants with constants on one side where it makes sense.

***** Subheaping
***** Heap dom inclusion
***** Inclusion in location
***** Subtyping
***** WF substs

**** Solutions

***** Index solutions
***** Index unifiers
***** Location substitutions
***** Heap domains
***** Location solutions

*** Consgen

** Done
   Nothing. ='(
