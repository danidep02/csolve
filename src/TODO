Fixing the malloc/init/unsoundness error
	- idea: when [Ins] is paired with a function-call instr, it refers to new
	  locations returned by call... This is bad, because you may want
	  to pass params _into_ functions to pass in params that can be
	  strongly updated...
	  For now, keep them apart.
	- for locations created by function calls, use [Ins] but 	
	[HERE]
	- spl. case for malloc in refanno, put in "New refanno"
	- spl. case for malloc in consgen, extend_world with [true] bindings ...

	- General function calls:
		- add [New] annots in refanno (to prevent bogus [Ins]
		  annots further downstream
		- extend_world with bindings generated by type of called
		  function...

- fix consgen bug to use ploc returned by find before remove/add.
- crunch deputy benchmarks into single file
- handling functions properly

Function Summaries/Signatures need to represent "new" cells.
Forall s,...
Forall+ s,...

malloc :: forall a, forall+ s. (x:{v:int| v>=0}) -> {v:ref(s,0)|size(v) = x} / s|-> a

Misc. Notes:

- implicit assumption that C program is well-formed -- i.e. does not read
  undefined variables, how ? 
  	1. when undef var flows into phi, 
	   drop phi-var binding from env when phi-var on RHS of flow constr.
	2. ignore flows into phi-vars from undefined vars (ie no constraints)
  why not just add constraints ? because Cil's desugaring messes up paths,
  adds bogus flows into phi-var along infeasible paths 

- each cell returned by malloc has "true" values

- nuke the ghastly .bnd state threaded through theoremProverZ3.ml
- make the constraints "polymorphic" (so we can tag with src-locations *)

**************************************************************

[rj] add "array-bounds-assertion"
[rj] combine: types + refanno + consgen

**************************************************************
The great merge:

TBD: compile! 

--^^^-- get small benchmarks working on above --^^^---

- add functions

foldn: (int -> 'a -> 'b prectype -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b LDesc.t -> 'a
