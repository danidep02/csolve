/*
 * MODIFICATIONS/CHEATS:
 *
 * - All key sizes/data sizes are (static) macros. These values were
 *   calculated (or supplied as input) in the original Java
 *   program. We were not able to handle division properly.
 *
 * - LCC_ASSUME in inv() due to arithmetic issues, lcc_mod.
 *
 * - Not a cheat per se, but >>> was replaced with >>, since C has
 *   unsigned types.
 *
 * - the for loop in run1() had its conditional changed to "i+8 <
 *   iupper" from "i < iupper". I believe this was a bug in the
 *   original program, unless the original program was assuming that
 *   iupper would be divisible by 8. 
 *
 * - changed do-while loop in run1() to while loop. We did not
 *   seem to be getting the correct guard information in the do-while
 *   version.
