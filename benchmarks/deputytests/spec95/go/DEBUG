- ANSI C does not define if a 'char' is signed or not and code uses values<0.
If you get differing results (run works but compare finds diffs) then
consider recompiling with a flag that tells your compiler to treat 'char'
as 'signed char' [-127, 128]
	[Fixed 10/26/94 ACA]

- This code does have some potential for indexing beyond array sizes.  I
believe that this will not occur, but it is theoretically possible that
some differences could be due to how perticular compilers layout data
structures (i.e.what values get returned when indexing beyond the end of
an array).
