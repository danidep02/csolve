This subdirectory contains the sources of functions to implement a dynamic
allocation of memory different than the one existing in the cthreads
package : with our policy, each processor has its own list of free spaces.
A space can be allocated by one processor and deallocated by another one :
it will return to the list of free spaces of the one which deallocates it.

Changes by Stephen Schwab (schwab@cs.cmu.edu):

Added alloc_par2.c, parallel version of standard powers-of-two allocator.
(This should be selected by flag -a2 on the command line)
