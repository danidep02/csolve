1. Rig pygments so that it takes in C file and produces:
    * each line is      
      <span line="%d"> ... </span>
    * each variable is  
      <span class="n" name="%s">...</span> 
    * each function is 
      <span class="nf" name=%s">...</name>
    
2. Use jQuery to write a templatized demo with
    * Highlighted Source

3. On mouseover Highlight
    * var      (all spans with class="n")
    * fun-use 
    * fun-def  (all spans with class="nf")

4. On click of var
    * write var-name, line in scoreboard

5. Extend Templatized Demo with ErrorLines (list of ints)
    * each int is shaded red (error-class in css, do a jQuery  addClass)



















demo for foo.c

1. Convert C code to html using source-highlight

	>> source-highlight --src-lang c --out-format html --line-number
	                    --input ll1.c --output ll1.c.html

more usage examples: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/examples.html

2. call "divpad.py" to add line number spans

	>> divpad.py ll1.c.html


3. write a python script that reads:

	ll1.c.vmap
	ll1.c.annot

   and writes a JS file with all the code we want AND two tables:
	
	vtab:: var, line   :-> ac_var
	ttab:: ac_var	   :-> liquid types (string)
	
   and two functions:

	typeOfSrcVar(var, line) -> string 
	typeOfName(var) 	-> string

4. generate a JS file that has the two functions listed above 

5. generate HTML file that includes the above (using PHP)

HEREHEREHERE
 
 Why the Fuck does the PYTHON file (c2html.py) not write the files? It
 seems unable to do so!!!! Dammit. Have to pipe everything to stdout? ugh.

write "template.html" the generic HTML file with:
(A) a textbox into which the clicked types are written.
(B) a function that gathers the type and writes it into the box above.
writeTypeOfSelectionLineToBox()
writeTypeOfSelectionToBox()

6. add var stack so you can chase types around
