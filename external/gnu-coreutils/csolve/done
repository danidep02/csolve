Globally, a lot of the examples compare argc and optind. How to
incorporate this reasoning?
aot clear that the spec for quote_n is correct.

* means shape only
+ means with serious work left to be done
;( means blocked on some feature
? means in-progress

 - double-check; it had weird optind stuff going on and maybe shouldn't have worked
tty
+ groups
+ nproc
  - Uses optarg and getopt. There is a dependency between c, the return value of optarg, the input option structure, and the global variable optarg. Should show that optarg is not null depending on the value of c.
basename    [AB] (with lcc_check_pos uncommented)
* tsort
* mkfifo    [RJ]
libstdbuf   [RJ]   
sleep       [RJ]    -- dependent-addrof issue
;( users    [AB]
 - requires nested arrays
getlimits   [AB]
 - revisit once contextual types are in
 - Need to check csolve_check_pos here
readlink
* setuidgid
 - NUL-terminated array
;( nice
 - NUL-terminated array
+ mknod [PMR]
  - One part of the code checks argv[optind][0] == 'p', then
    another part uses that test; however, we can't propagate that
    info because we can't show that argv[optind] is final, as that
    location is global. (pmr_argchar)
  - We have to fold optind at all function calls because it's in a global
    location, which means we have to manually constant fold for some
    reasoning. (pmr_optind)
  - Complex control flow involving case switches and gotos gets us into
    a situation where the guards imply a fact is true at a block, but no
    guard *dominates* that block, so we have to make a witness variable
    for the fact. (pmr_case_witness)
;( uptime [MK]
  - Contains a non-flat struct in a non-trivial way
? tac-mem [AB]
? nohup [PMR]
? rmdir [PMR]
? runcon [AB]
  - selinux.h is defined with nops that most likely trick csolve into thinking
    Sections of code are not executed. There is certainly more work to be done here.
? chroot [AB]
echo [AB]
? env [MK]
